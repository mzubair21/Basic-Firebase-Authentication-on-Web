# Basic-Firebase-Authentication-on-Web
In this repo, I have created a basic login form and connected its authentication of Email and Password using Firebase.  It contains the simplest demonstration of basic (SignUp, SignIn, SignOut, and DeleteUser methods). I invite everyone to run this webpage (index.html) to experience it's working, and I have also attached a Demo.mp4 to show it's working. Your Feedbacks will be appreciated. Software Requirement : A Browser (Google, Firefox, Opera, etc)
